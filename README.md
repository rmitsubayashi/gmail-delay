# Gmail Delay
An app script for gmail for people that randomly check their mail expecting something in their inbox.
This restricts when mail enters your inbox. Instead of immediately getting email, you set a timer so you get all your email at that specified time.
Inspired by Adios.ai. Since Adios.ai is blocked by Google because it accesses sensitive information, I decided to make my own version that I can run locally.
